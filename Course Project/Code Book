1: Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2: Read the data
features: Feature ID and corresponding name of feature

train_data: Training Data

test_data: Test Data


3: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
variable_names:extract only mean and sd of each measurement

4.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
combined_data: Combined Training and Test Data that is filtered for mean and std

5. Load Data label and combine train and test label
train_label: Label for training data

test_label: Label for test data

combined_label: Combined label for Training and Test Data with rbind

6. Load Activity
activity_label: Activity ID and corresponding name of activity

7. Load subject and combine train and test suject
subject_train<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
subject_test<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")

8:Combine Label, subject and data with cbind
data_label_subject: combine label, subject and data with cbind

9: merge activity labels with data_label_subject
data_label_subject: merge activity labels with using left join

10: From the data set created at the end of the 4th step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
